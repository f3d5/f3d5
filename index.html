        Are you tired of wasting money buying configs that won't tap anything and just hit feet? Are you done with shitty devs that act like crap and don't help you do or set up anything if you're new? <br /><br />
        <strong>We have the solution!</strong> Our Discord has some very talented Devs who will help you set everything up and help you with anything else. Our CFG has been tested over hours of our own time to try to make it as good as possible. We hope to see you in our Discord soon! -Hazy
